# Hi welcome to my portfolio!

I have consolidated a handful of data anlysis projects that I have done. 

1. 3D Resistivity Data Analysis & Plotting (Matlab)
    - In this analysis I walk through how I filtered my electrical resistivity data by analyzing the distribution of values. Then I show how I plotted the filtered and processed data in 3D space. 

2. RockPhysics Model Validation (Matlab)
      - In this analysis I use linear regression to determine if the model predicted volumetric water content of the soil is the same as the measured volumetric water content in the soil.

3. Tornadoes Machine Learning & Analysis (Python & Tableau)
