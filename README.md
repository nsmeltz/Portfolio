# Hi welcome to my portfolio!

I have consolidated a handful of data anlysis projects that I have done. Two of the folder hold examples of data analysis for my geophysical research in Matlab. The other two projects are from my data analytics course including work in Tableau and Python. 
1. 3D Resistivity Data Analysis & Plotting (Matlab)
    - In this analysis I walk through how I filtered my electrical resistivity data by analyzing the distribution of values. Then I show how I plotted the filtered and processed data in 3D space. 
2. RockPhysics Model Validation (Matlab)
  - In this analysis I use linear regression to determine if the model predicted volumetric water content of the soil is the same as the measured volumetric water content in the soil.
3. CitiBike Analysis (Tableau)
4. Tornadoes Machine Learning & Analysis (Python & Tableau)
