# Hi welcome to my portfolio!

I have consolidated a handful of data anlysis projects that I have done. 

1. Geophysical 3D Plotting
    - Language & Application: Matlab
    - In this analysis I walk through how I filtered my electrical resistivity data by analyzing the distribution of values. Then I show how I plotted the filtered and processed data in 3D space. 

2. RockPhysics Model Validation
    - Language & Application: Matlab
    - In this analysis I use linear regression to determine if the model predicted volumetric water content of the soil is the same as the measured volumetric water content in the soil.

3. SQL Querying
    - Language & Application: PostgreSQL (PGAdmin)
    - In this example I demonstrate how I set up a database & tables in PostgreSQL. Then I used SQL queries to determine the number of retiring employees based on certain criteria.

4. Tornadoes Analysis
    - Language & Application: Python (Jupyter Notebook & Google CoLab) & Tableau
    - In this analysis I use 3 machine learning algorithms to predict the EF rating for a tornado dataset from 1950-2020. I also show a Tableau story analyzing aspects of the tornado dataset.
